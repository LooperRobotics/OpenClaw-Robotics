# OpenClaw-Robotics
High-performance control stack for Embodied AI powered by the OpenClaw ecosystem. Designed for high-dynamic platforms including Humanoids and Quadrupeds, this repo provides unified whole-body control (WBC) interfaces, sim-to-real pipelines, and low-latency hardware abstraction. The bridge from neural perception to physical action.
